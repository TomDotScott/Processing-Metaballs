# Processing-Metaballs
A simple program to demo metaballs within the processing creative coding environment. The solution uses circle objects that move across the screen and bounce against the walls. The Processing pixels array is updated based on the distance of these circles from each other and shows a visually appealing range of colours depending on the distance.
